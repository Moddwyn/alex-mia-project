  title: Boulder Blade
  gameSummary: After a mission went awry in the far mountains, a knight is left to
    fend for survival as an avalanche threatens what little there is to fight for. 
    Armed with nothing but two swords and an unwavering resolve, the knight engages
    in a daring windmill dance of steel against the unrelenting forces of nature,
    a testament of valor etched in the clash between blade and stone.
  gameInstructions: Execute a sweeping circular gesture with your left arm to set
    your left sword in motion, mirrored by a similar motion with your right arm for
    the right sword. Combine both arm movements simultaneously in a forward circular
    motion to synchronize the swing of both swords. Caution is paramount, as enduring
    five strikes culminates in perilous defeat.
