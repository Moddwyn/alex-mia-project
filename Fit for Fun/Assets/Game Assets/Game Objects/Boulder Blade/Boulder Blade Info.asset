  gameSummary: Amidst the chaos of a raging avalanche, a lone knight stood resolute
    on the mountainside. Armed with two gleaming swords, he deftly whirled and sliced
    at the colossal boulders hurtling down towards him by rotating his arms forward
    for each swing.
  gameInstructions: Execute a sweeping circular gesture with your left arm to set
    your left sword in motion, mirrored by a similar motion with your right arm for
    the right sword. Combine both arm movements simultaneously in a forward circular
    motion to synchronize the swing of both swords. Caution is paramount, as enduring
    five hits from boulders will cause defeat.
