  gameSummary: Pirates have come to raid your island, seeing valuable treasure that
    they wish to take for themselves.  As they begin to fire upon you with their
    ship's cannons, you must shuffle side to side to move out of the way and try
    to avoid the projectiles.
  gameInstructions: Take a step to the left with one foot, then bring your right
    foot over to meet the left one, shoulder width apart resulting in a squatting
    position. Then touch your left foot with your left hand to move the player to
    the left. And vise versa to the right. Keep doing this back and forth, to avoid
    the cannonballs and survive as long as possible, but if you get struck five times,
    you will lose. You can stand do a squatting position in the middle of the screen
    to stand still.
