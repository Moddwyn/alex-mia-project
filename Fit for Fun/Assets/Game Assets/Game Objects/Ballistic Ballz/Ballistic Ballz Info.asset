  gameSummary: Pirates have come to raid your island, seeing valuable treasure that
    they wish to take for themselves.  As they begin to fire upon you with their
    ship's cannons, you must do single leg stands to move out of the way and try
    to avoid the projectiles.
  gameInstructions: Stand on your left leg to run left and stand your right leg to
    run right.  Avoid the cannonballs to survive as long as possible, but if you
    get struck five times, you will lose.
