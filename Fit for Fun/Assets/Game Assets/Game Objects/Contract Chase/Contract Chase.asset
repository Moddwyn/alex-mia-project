  gameSummary: A nefarious crime has been perpetrated in a town, followed by an attempted
    escape.  As the preeminent bounty hunter of the town, it falls upon you to relentlessly
    pursue the perpetrator, chasing through the rugged trail by doing high knees,
    all in the steadfast pursuit of upholding justice.
  gameInstructions: Stand in one spot and lift your knees up towards your chest one
    at a time, as if you're marching really high. After 2 seconds of no activity,
    you have 5 seconds of grace before the perpetrator get away and loose the game.
