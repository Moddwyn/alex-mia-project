  gameSummary: While traversing a desert canyon, an unexpected encounter unfolds
    as an alien nest comes into view. Subsequently, a pursuit ensues, featuring a
    pair of ravenous extraterrestrial beings. Swiftly navigating the terrain, you
    have to engage in side to side jumps, evading obstacles that come my way.
  gameInstructions: Execute leftward jumps for leftward slides and perform rightward
    jumps to initiate corresponding slides to the right. Exercise caution to avoid
    collisions with objects, as such an occurrence would lead to the aliens catching
    you and resulting in game over.
