  title: Soaring Sparrow
  gameSummary: Being motivated by a natural instinct to find a secure and secluded
    location for its nest, a bird curiously ventured into the pipe maze. Intrigued
    by the twists and turns, it hopped and flapped its wings with the same energy
    as performing jumping jacks to navigate through the confined spaces in pursuit
    of a safe spot shielded from the elements and potential threats.
  gameInstructions: Stand with your arms at your sides and your feet together, before
    jumping with your arms and legs spread out like a star to make the bird briefly
    fly up.  Afterwards, jump back into the starting position and repeat the process. 
    Don't let the bird fall into the pit below, or get too high or make contact with
    any pipes, or else the bird won't reach its potential nest.
