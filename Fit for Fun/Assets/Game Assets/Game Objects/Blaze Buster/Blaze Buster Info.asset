  gameSummary: Children had been playing in a house, when they accidentally turned
    on the stove and unknowingly set their house on fire!  Being a renowned and fearless
    firefighter, you were summoned to the scene and came prepared with a hose.  Using
    squats to pump the hose, you must be swift to put out the fire.
  gameInstructions: Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, then pretend
    you're sitting down by bending your knees while keeping your back straight. Make
    sure your knees point in the same direction as your toes and don't go lower than
    is comfortable. Push through your heels to stand back up. Repeat this motion
    to do a squat. Squatting down will push down on the water pipe to spray water
    at the burning house. Taking out the fire will result in victory.
